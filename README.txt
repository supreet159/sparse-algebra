This is a small extract of a bigger sparse algebra project which is still in development. 
This small project contains 2 modules: 
1) Kahan summation of floating point numbers (kahan_floats)
2) LU decomposition of a square matrix (lu_decomposition)

Using the two modules we perform matrix operations like:
1) inverse and 
2) computing condition number of a matrix. 

There are two demo files which demonstrates
1) demo.py - demonstrates inverse and condition number using lu decomposition
2) demo_kahan.py - demonstrates the importance of kahan algorithm using summation of small and large vectors
